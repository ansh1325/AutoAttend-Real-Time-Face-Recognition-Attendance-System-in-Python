# AutoAttend: Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System in Python

This project is a **real-time face recognition-based attendance system** built with Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library.  
It detects faces through your webcam, matches them against stored images, and logs attendance into a CSV file with timestamps.
